    "## Motivation\n",
    "In today's world, text is omnipresent, which is more than just a form of communication. From the briefest tweets to in-depth blog posts, from academic papers to business emails, this digital landscape is full of textual content. In such a text-saturated environment, the ability to read, analyze and derive meaning from written content is essential and meaningful. This is where our comprehensive text analysis package `wordwright` enters the picture. It's not only a text-processing tool, it's a bridge to understanding the world from overwhelmed text. Our package empowers various professionals by meeting their demands through cleaning unrelevant puncatuations, calculating the number of identified keywords and sentences, detecting the paragraph language, and ranking the word frequency. Potential users such as marketers, journalists, educators and healthcare professionals could be beneficial from this package. \n"

    "## Count sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "We can count the number of sentences in a given text. This function is particularly useful to understand the text structure in readability assessments, summarization tasks, or content analysis to prepare for a more in-depth text analysis. It can accurately identify sentence boundaries, which can vary with periods, exclamation marks, question marks, or other punctuation used to denote the end of a sentence. User could identify specific punctuations which use to seperate each sentence and thus calculate the total number of sentences. \n",

    "### Example Usage\n",
    "Given the context in healthcare domain, patients submit their sympton descriptions via an online clinical system to provide healthcare professionals first-hand information about their health concerns before they arriving the clinic. "
