    "## Introduction\n",
    "The `wordwright` package is a useful tool for textual data analysis, perfect for extracting insights from reviews, feedback, or any written content. In this vignette, we demonstrate how `wordwright` can be used to analyze Airbnb reviews, providing a clear path from raw text to insightful data. Whether you are a data scientist, a student, or just someone curious about text analytics, `wordwright` provides intuitive functions to transform raw text into actionable data.\n",
